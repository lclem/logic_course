# Teaching material

- ["Mathematical Logic"](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387942582) by Ebbinghaus, Flum, and Thomas.
  - A classical book covering pure logic
- ["Handbook of Practical Logic and Automated Reasoning"](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/atp/) by John Harrison [[vid1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nydg-N83VYc)[[vid2]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPFJY0aW4E4)[[vid3]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdJ0-V77f_0)[[vid4]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3EQKBMq5h0)
  - Great source of inspiration for a more applied approach to logic.
- **NEW!** [Problem book]().
  - It will be the main source of problems for the tutorials.
- [Past exams](https://moodle.mimuw.edu.pl/mod/url/view.php?id=13772).

# Learning points
- SAT project: 20 points = 10 public tests + 10 private tests.
  - For each test: Timeout (1 min): 0 points. Correct: 1 point. Incorrect: -1 point.
  - Must show their code to their lab tutor before (and including) their respective last lab.
- COQ project: 10 points.
  - Deadline for submission: two weeks after the task is given.
- Mid-term exam: 30 points (3 problems).
- Final exam: 40 points = 10 (10 test questions) + 30 (3 problems).
- Book feedback: +1 point for every legitimate factual mistake found (excluding spelling mistakes), awarded to the first student.
- Final score: min(SAT +  COQ + MIDTERM + FINAL + BOOK, 100).
